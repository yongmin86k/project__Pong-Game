- Single player 
&nbsp;

    - This play mode is not available.

- Multi-players
&nbsp;

    - 2 players compete each other. 
    - Use `a`, `z` keys for player 1 and `â–²`, `â–¼` keys for player 2.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### - Step 2 : Start playing with keyboard

- Player 1 is `Red` and plyaer 2 is `Cyan`.

- The ball will move in 30fps after game begins.
    &nbsp;

    This time can be modified in the file settings.js (`./src/images/setting.js`) and the property(`intervalGameTime: 30`).
- The other player's paddle shrinks by `8` points if ball is hit.
    &nbsp;

    The paddle shrinks until the height is `16` point long.
- Use special keys `f`, `v`, `g`, `b` for more dynamic play.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### - Step 3 : Winning

&nbsp;

    This number can be modified in the file settings.js (`./src/images/setting.js`) and the property(`winningScore: 10`).

## Deploy

The deployment workflow for this project will be a bit different from what you've used when deploying simple static websites.

To deploy your finished Pong project as a GitHub page, you must first **update the `predeploy` script in the `package.json` file with the name of your repo.**

For example, if your repo URL is:

https://github.com/bob/pong-project

Update the `predeploy` script as follows:

```json
"predeploy": "rm -rf src && parcel build index.html --public-url /pong-project",
```

Once you have done this, you can run:

`$ npm run deploy`

Now check out your deployed site ðŸ™‚
